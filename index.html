    <h3> Welcome ! My name is Sama </h3>
      <p>
      I am currently enrolled as a full time student in the Digital Marketing certificate program at UCLA Extension. Before I moved to LA ealier this year, I was living in London where I did my Master's in Digital Anthropology from University College London. If I am not making marketing plans or learning how to code you can find me cooking, listening to music, doing Pilates or enjoying the LA sunshine. I am using a MacBook Pro :)

      All the instructions were very easy to follow and very well put out. The only time I ran into trobule was at the end while pulling the changes from GitHub to my Dream Host server. After googling a few terms and going back to the video I managed to solve it. I am still not sure if the changes are visible(I hope they are!)
